*Introduction
This project aims to predict house prices in Bangalore using various features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms (BHK), and number of bathrooms. The model is deployed as a Flask application, allowing users to input data and receive real-time predictions.
1.Data Preparation
2.Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, corrected data types, and ensured data consistency.
3.Categorical to Numeric Conversion: Applied one-hot encoding to convert categorical features into numeric format.
4.Outlier Analysis: Identified and treated outliers to enhance model performance.
5.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
6.Performed comprehensive EDA to understand the data distribution, feature correlations, and uncover patterns.
7.Feature Engineering
One-Hot Encoding: Converted categorical variables into numeric format.
8.Train-Test Split: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.
9.Model Training
Trained multiple machine learning models and selected the best performing model based on evaluation metrics. The final model was saved as a pickle file for deployment.
10.Deployment
Developed a Flask application to serve the model and provide predictions. The app allows users to input features and get the estimated house price.
